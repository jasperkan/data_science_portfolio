# Data Science Portfolio

This is a portfolio of my data science projects, presented using iPython notebooks. 

- **Machine Learning**
  - [Image Classification with Traditional Machine Learning Models](https://github.com/jasperkan/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Image%20Classification%20with%20Traditional%20ML%20Models/Image%20Classification%20with%20Traditional%20ML%20Models.ipynb): Classified 20 categories of images using Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM and Random Forest models, trained on manually extracted features from an augmented dataset.
  - [Predicting Legendary Status of a Pokemon Using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/jasperkan/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Predicting%20Legendary%20Status%20of%20a%20Pokemon%20Using%20Logistic%20Regression/Predicting%20Legendary%20Status%20of%20a%20Pokemon%20Using%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb): Predicted whether a Pokemon is a legendary one by looking at their basic stats, such as HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.
  - *Tools: Python | numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, skimage, sklearn*
  
- **Data Analysis**
  - [Evaluation of Subscription Renewal Reminder Feature with A/B Testing](https://github.com/jasperkan/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Evaluation%20of%20Subscription%20Renewal%20Reminder%20Feature%20with%20AB%20Testing/Evaluation%20of%20Subscription%20Renewal%20Reminder%20Feature%20with%20AB%20Testing.ipynb): Evaluated the benefits of implementing the subscription renewal reminder feature by looking at user acquisition rate and expected revenue per account.
   - *Tools: Python | numpy, pandas, statsmodels*
